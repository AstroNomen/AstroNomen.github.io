      <description>&amp;lsquo;Phonon coherences reveal the polaronic character of excitons in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites&amp;rsquo;
Introduction Hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have become an interesting area in materials science owing to their unique optical and electronic characteristics, and have been widely used in the preparation of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells[1]. The distinct lattice structures of these quantum well-like derivatives result in unique behaviour. To elucidate the peculiar nature of these materials, Félix Thouin and his colleagues delve into the interaction between excitons and phonons in 2D lead halide perovskites, providing significant insights into their polaronic nature and the resultant impact on their optoelectronic properties in the paper I reviewed, which confer both structural flexibility and remarkable electronic characteristics.</description>

      <description>Abstract—The motion of star systems will cause a Doppler shift on the spectrum, providing valuable insights into the dynamics and characteristics of celestial objects. Astronomical deep space exploration necessitates the use of high-precision astronomical spectrographs to analyze the subtle variations in Doppler shift observed in stellar absorption lines. Astrocombs serve as essential tools for the precision calibration of astronomical spectrographs, playing a crucial role in advancing the fields of cosmology and exoplanet research.</description>

      <description>This paper is collaborated between me and my colleague Songyu Yao. This is our literature review of Printed artificial cilia from liquid-crystal network actuators modularly driven by light, which is written by Casper L. van Oosten, Cees W. M. Bastiaansen and Dirk J. Broer on Nature Materials.
Introduction of Basic Concepts Liquid Crystals Liquid crystals (LC) are materials with anisotropy, the position of molecules can be randomly arranged, which means it can flow like a liquid, but the molecules are fixed oriented.</description>
