Hello! Here is **Zhifan (Charles) Dai**. For convenience, you can just call me Zhifan, or my English name Charles directly. 

Now I am a master student of photonics engineering at University Ghent.

Welcome to my research blog, where I archive my personal academic research collections and works. The title of this site, ***"SSS"***, stands for ***"Studying Something Shining"***, referring to the field of photonics that I am dedicating. I love this shiny science.

The pillars are part of a small region of the Eagle Nebula, a vast star-forming region 6,500 light-years from Earth. The colors in the image highlight emission from several chemical elements. Oxygen emission is blue, sulfur is orange, and hydrogen and nitrogen are green.
