Astronomical deep space exploration necessitates the use of high-precision astronomical spectrographs to analyze the subtle variations in Doppler shift observed in stellar absorption lines. Astrocombs serve as essential tools for the precision calibration of astronomical spectrographs, playing a crucial role in advancing the fields of cosmology and exoplanet research.","tags":["Astrocomb","Literature Review"],"title":"Recent Trends in Astrocomb","type":"post","url":"/post/astrocomb/","weight":0,"wordcount":2935},{"author":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":"A design scheme for grating couplers based on Silica, target work wavelength at 266nm.","date":1685617200,"description":"A design scheme for grating couplers based on Silica, target work wavelength at 266nm.","dir":"post\\","excerpt_html":"A design scheme for grating couplers based on Silica, target work wavelength at 266nm.","excerpt_text":"A design scheme for grating couplers based on Silica, target work wavelength at 266nm.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":3200,"html":"A design scheme for grating couplers based on Silica, target work wavelength at 266nm.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1685617200,"objectID":"b1d7984893df55fa794e620594f279c2","permalink":"https://astronomen.github.io/post/uvcgrating/","publishdate":"2023-06-01T12:00:00+01:00","readingtime":15,"relpermalink":"/post/uvcgrating/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is defined as a type of electromagnetic radiation, with a wavelength (100–400nm) shorter than that of visible light (400–700nm), but longer than x-rays (\u0026lt;100 nm)[1]. Ultra Violet C irradiation (UVC) ranges from 100 to 280nm in wavelength. UV irradiation is divided into four distinct spectral areas including vacuum UV (100–200 nm), UVC (200–280 nm), UVB (280–315 nm) and UVA (315–400 nm)[2].\nDue to its power to damage the genetic material (DNA and RNA) of microorganisms, which can prevent them from producing, UVC irradiation is widely used in disinfection and sterilization.","tags":["Grating Design","Lumerical","Simulation"],"title":"Ultra Violet C Irradiation Grating Coupler Design","type":"post","url":"/post/uvcgrating/","weight":0,"wordcount":3136},{"author":null,"categories":["Review"],"content":"Ink-jet Printing used in producing Liquid Crystal Actuator.
